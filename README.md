## Features
- Dual Mode Trading: The expert advisor supports both automatic and manual trading modes.
- Automatic Mode: In automatic mode, the expert advisor identifies trends in a larger time frame and searches for entry points in a smaller time frame to place trades.
- Manual Mode: In manual mode, the expert advisor allows the user to manually select the trading direction (UP or DOWN) and opens trades accordingly.
- Trend Identification: The expert advisor uses a function called IdentifyTrend() to determine the trend in the larger time frame.
- Entry Point Search: The expert advisor uses a function called SearchEntryPoints() to search for entry points in the smaller time frame.
- Trade Execution: The expert advisor opens buy or sell trades based on the identified trends and entry points.

## Usage
1. Set the `automaticMode` variable to `true` if you want to use automatic trading mode. Set it to `false` if you want to use manual trading mode.
2. If using manual trading mode, set the `manualDirection` variable to the desired trading direction: `UP` for buy trades or `DOWN` for sell trades.
3. Implement the necessary code in the `IdentifyTrend()` function to identify trends in the larger time frame.
4. Implement the necessary code in the `SearchEntryPoints()` function to search for entry points in the smaller time frame.
5. Implement the necessary code in the `OpenBuyTrade()` and `OpenSellTrade()` functions to open buy and sell trades respectively.
6. Replace the placeholder trade execution logic in the `OpenBuyTrade()` and `OpenSellTrade()` functions with your actual trade execution logic.
